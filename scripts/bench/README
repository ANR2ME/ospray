Running Benchmarks
------------------

1. Build OSPRay

Compile OSPRay in a build directory of your choosing. We will refer
to this directory as ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}.

2. Fetch bechmark data using provided script

In ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}, run the "get_benchmark_data.sh" script. Thus
from a "build" directory inside your cloned OSPRay source, you would
run:

% ../scripts/bench/get_benchmark_data.sh

3. Run benchmark script

In ${OSPRAY_BUILD_DIR}, run the "run_benchmark.sh" script. Using the
same directory structure from step 2, you would run:

% ../scripts/bench/run_benchmark_sh
